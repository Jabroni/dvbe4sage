DVB Network Encoder for SageTV Media Center

SageTV is a well established Media Center platform with many unique capabilities. Unfortunately, its support for digital broadcasting recording is limited. DVB Enhancer allows SageTV users to extend it in the following ways:

Zero configuration/maintenance of (sometimes hundreds of) channels.
Simultaneous multiple program recording using a single physical tuner, provided the programs are on the same transponder.
Scrambled content recording using legal subscription cards (with MDAPI-compatible plugins).
