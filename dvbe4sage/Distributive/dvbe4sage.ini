; This setting tells the program to write down only one PAT packet of "PATDilutionFactor", this helps to reduce the recorded file size
;PATDilutionFactor=1
; This setting tells the program to write down only one PMT packet of "PMTDilutionFactor", this helps to reduce the recorded file size
;PMTDilutionFactor=1
; This setting is used to decide if the channel is FTA, that is, we consider is FTA if we haven't seen a CAT packet for "PMTThreshold" PMT packets
;PMTThreshold=20
; This setting tells the program to decide the PSI structures are mature enough to use for the next tuning operation after "PSIMaturityTime" seconds
;PSIMaturityTime=10
