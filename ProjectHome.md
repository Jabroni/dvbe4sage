[SageTV](http://www.sagetv.com/) is a well established Media Center platform with many unique capabilities.
Unfortunately, its support for digital broadcasting recording is limited.
DVB Enhancer allows SageTV users to extend it in the following ways:
  1. Zero configuration/maintenance of (sometimes hundreds of) channels.
  1. Simultaneous multiple program recording using a single physical tuner, provided the programs are on the same transponder.
  1. Scrambled content recording using legal subscription cards (with MDAPI-compatible plugins).
